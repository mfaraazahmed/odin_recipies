**What I Learned from the Odin Recipes Project**

The Odin Recipes project is a basic HTML web page that displays links to various recipe pages. Through this project, I learned the following concepts:

- **HTML Structure :** I learned the basics of HTML document structure, including how to create headings, paragraphs, links, and anchor tags. I also learned about the DOCTYPE declaration, the html element, the head and body tags, and the meta tag.

- **HTML Links** : I learned how to create links in HTML, both internal and external. I learned how to use the a tag and the href attribute to create hyperlinks to other web pages.

- **Web Page Development** : I learned about basic web page development practices, including how to structure web pages, how to create and link to separate HTML files, and how to host web pages on a public platform such as GitHub Pages.

Overall, the Odin Recipes project provided a good introduction to HTML and basic web page development, and helped me gain a better understanding of how to structure and create basic web pages.

**NOTE** : This project was completed as an assignment during my enrollment in "The Odin Project" course._
